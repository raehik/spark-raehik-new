## Things not reflected in roles or falco-arch notes
  * Dolphin Slippi Vulkan seems to require something *other than* `amdvlk`.
    Probably `vulkan-radeon`, I installed a bunch at the same time. I have to
    use the adapter that has less info in it -- the other one (from `amdvlk`)
    gives 40-50 FPS gameplay, and kinda destroys Fox netplay.

## Looking forwad
  * Booster https://github.com/anatol/booster
    * no good yet (simply doesn't boot for me) but cool
  * Just keep googling "arch secure boot tpm" honestly

## Roles
  * aur (yay)
  * music - mpdscribble
  * desktop - ibus, ibus-mozc

### base
  * network/chrony: more config (all in Arch Wiki, also see pigmonkey/spark)
    * only attempt sync when online
    * non-default `/etc/chrony.conf` (though default is fine tbh)
